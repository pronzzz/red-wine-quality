## **🍷🍷🍷Red Wine Quality Prediction Model🍷🍷🍷**

🍷🍇 **About the Model:**

- Predicts the quality of red wine based on its chemical composition.
- Built using Random Forest Classifier for accurate results.
- Features:
   - 11 input features, including alcohol, acidity, sugar content, etc.
   - Target: Quality score from 3 to 9.
- Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation.

📊 **Performance:**

- Achieved an impressive accuracy score of 72.5% on the test set.
- Visualized decision tree structure for better understanding.

🚀 **How to Use:**

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/red-wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Wine-quality Model.ipynb`) to train and evaluate the model.

📝 **Note:**

- This model is suitable for predicting the quality of red wine. For other types of wine, a different model may be needed.
- Results may vary based on the specific dataset and hyperparameter tuning.
